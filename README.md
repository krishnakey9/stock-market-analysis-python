# 📈 Stock Market Analysis System using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The Stock Market Analysis System is a Python-based application developed to analyze historical stock market data using technical analysis techniques. The system visualizes price trends and commonly used indicators to help understand market behavior and support informed decision-making.

This project is developed as a **BCA 6th Semester Major Project** and demonstrates the practical application of Python in financial data analysis and visualization.

## 🎯 Objectives
- To analyze historical stock price data
- To compute and visualize technical indicators
- To provide an interactive graphical interface for analysis
- To understand market trends using price, volume, and momentum indicators

---

## 🔧 Features
- Stock price visualization
- Simple Moving Averages (SMA 20, SMA 50)
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA 20)
- Relative Strength Index (RSI)
- Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)
- Volume analysis
- Interactive charts with zoom and pan functionality
- GUI-based stock selection using Tkinter
